{"body":"![logo](https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/casadi/raw-attachment/wiki/TitleIndex/casadi.png)\r\n\r\nCasADi is a symbolic framework for [automatic differentiation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation) and numeric optimization. Using the syntax of computer algebra systems, it implements automatic differentiation in forward and adjoint modes by means of a hybrid symbolic/numeric approach. \r\n\r\nThe main purpose of the tool is to be a low-level tool for quick, yet highly efficient implementation of algorithms for numerical optimization. Of particular interest is dynamic optimization, using either a collocation approach, or a shooting-based approach using embedded ODE/DAE-integrators. In either case, CasADi relieves the user from the work of efficiently calculating the relevant derivative or ODE/DAE sensitivity information to an arbitrary degree, as needed by the NLP solver. This together with full-featured [Python](http://www.python.org/) and [Octave](http://www.octave.org/) front ends, as well as back ends to state-of-the-art codes such as [Sundials](https://computation.llnl.gov/casc/sundials/main.html) (CVODES, IDAS and KINSOL), [IPOPT](http://www.coin-or.org/Ipopt/) and [KNITRO](http://www.ziena.com/knitro.html), drastically reduces the effort of implementing the methods compared to a pure C/C++/Fortran approach.\r\n\r\nEvery feature of CasADi (with very few exceptions) is available in C++, Python and Octave, with little to no difference in performance, so the user has the possibility of working completely in C++, Python or Octave or mixing the languages. We recommend new users to try out the Python version first, since it allows interactivity and is more stable and better documented than the Octave front-end.\r\n\r\nCasADi is an open-source tool, written in self-contained C++ code, depending only on the Standard Template Library. It is developed by Joel Andersson and Joris Gillis at the [Optimization in Engineering Center, OPTEC](http://www.kuleuven.be/optec/) of the K.U. Leuven under supervision of [Moritz Diehl](http://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/~mdiehl/). CasADi is distributed under the [LGPL](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html) license, meaning the code can be used royalty-free even in commercial applications.\r\n\r\nFor installation instructions, help and support, visit the [CasADi wiki](https://github.com/casadi/casadi/wiki)","note":"Don't delete this file!
